                <p>An evidence-based course to combat stress, anxiety & depression</p>
                <p>Feeling worn out by stress? Anxious or depressed? Find out how simple yoga & mindfulness techniques can help.</p>

                <p>The course combines asanas (yoga postures), pranayama (breath-work), and restorative mindfulness and meditation practices, which allow students to deeply understand how these practices can work for them in the short term to provide immediate relief and in the long term to create and maintain positive mental health. The course is great for those looking to manage day to day levels of stress as well as those suffering from anxiety disorders & depression. The course cost includes a comprehensive manual and CD of practices.</p>
                <p>The weekly sessions are specifically designed to rebalance the nervous system and to teach you how to regulate mood and emotions. You’ll be taught which postures are useful for energising and which are useful for bringing calm to your system. The course looks at a new theme each week enabling you to explore your yoga practice through different perspectives. Weekly home practices keep you on track.
